# Welcome to my portfolio

Here you can see how I built my 2023 website and what my way of working is.  
The technologies I used are **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, **TypeScript**, and **GSAP** for the animations.

## Run project locally

_If you don’t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en). You’ll need Node.js version 18 or higher._

```bash
  npm install
```
```bash
  npm run dev
```

To see if it’s workin, open http://localhost:3000 from your browser.
